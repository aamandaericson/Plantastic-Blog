# Plantastic Blog
Plantastic is a plant blog where you can read about different sorts of plants and get advise for plant care. You can interact with other members of the plant community by creating an account and have discussions about the plants posted. This is therefore a fantastic place for both plant beginners and experienced plant carers to share questions and knowledge.

## Project Development
This project is still in early stages of development and is therefore still very much based on the Code Institute walkthrough project **I Think Therefore I Blog** for setting up data bases and installing libraries needed for starting up the project.

## Bugs
### Deployment to Heroku
When deploying the project to the heroku app this error message was recieved:

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python-apt==2.4.0+ubuntu1 (from versions: 0.0.0, 0.7.8)
       ERROR: No matching distribution found for python-apt==2.4.0+ubuntu1
 !     Push rejected, failed to compile Python app.
 !     Push failed

 This will be taking up with tutor suport.
